Chapter I
Instructions
e Only this page serves as your reference, do not trust rumors.
e Watch out! This document may change before submission.
e Ensure you have the appropriate permissions on your files and directories.
e You must follow the submission procedures for all your exercises.
e Your exercises will be checked and graded by your fellow classmates.
e Additionally, your exercises will be evaluated by a program called Moulinette.
e Moulinette is meticulous and strict in its assessment. It is fully automated, and
there is no way to negotiate with it. To avoid unpleasant surprises, be as thorough
as possible.
e Moulinette is not open-minded. If your code does not adhere to the Norm, it won’t
attempt to understand it. Moulinette relies on a program called norminette to
check if your files comply with the Norm. TL;DR: Submitting work that doesn’t
pass norminette’s check makes no sense.
e These exercises are arranged in order of difficulty, from easiest to hardest. We will
not consider a successfully completed harder exercise if an easier one is not fully
functional.
e Using a forbidden function is considered cheating. Cheaters receive a grade of -42,
which is non-negotiable.
e You only need to submit a main() function if we specifically ask for a program.
e Moulinette compiles with the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror, using
cc.
e If your program does not compile, you will receive a grade of 0.
e You cannot leave any additional file in your directory beyond those specified in
the assignment.
e Have a question? Ask the peer on your right. If not, try the peer on your left.

C Piscine C 00
e Your reference guide is called Google / man / the Internet / ...
e Check the "C Piscine" section of the forum on the intranet or the Piscine on Slack.
e Carefully examine the examples. They may contain crucial details that are not
explicitly stated in the assignment...
e By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
\ ' Don’t forget to include the standard 42 header in each of your .c
S and .h files. Norminette checks for its presence anyway!
Norminette must be run with the -R CheckForbiddenSourceHeader flag.
Moulinette will use it too.

Chapter II
Al Instructions
O Context
The C Piscine is intense. It’s your first big challenge at 42 — a deep dive into problem-
solving, autonomy, and community.
During this phase, your main objective is to build your foundation — through struggle,
repetition, and especially peer-learning exchange.
In the Al era, shortcuts are easy to find. However, it’s important to consider whether your
Al usage is truly helping you grow — or simply getting in the way of developing real skills.
The Piscine is also a human experience — and for now, nothing can replace that. Not
even Al.
For a more complete overview of our stance on AI — as a learning tool, as part of the
ICT curriculum, and as a growing expectation in the job market — please refer to the
dedicated FAQ available on the intranet.
O Main message
@ Build strong foundations without shortcuts.
© Really develop tech & power skills.
@ Experience real peer-learning, start learning how to learn and solve new problems.
@ The learning journey is more important than the result.
@ Learn about the risks associated with AI, and develop effective control practices
and countermeasures to avoid common pitfalls.

C Piscine C 00
O Learner rules:
e You should apply reasoning to your assigned tasks, especially before turning to AI.
e You should not ask for direct answers to the AI.
e You should learn about 42 global approach on Al.
O Phase outcomes:
Within this foundational phase, you will get the following outcomes:
e Get proper tech and coding foundations.
e Know why and how AI can be dangerous during this phase.
O Comments and example:
e Yes, we know AI exists — and yes, it can solve your projects. But you’re here to
learn, not to prove that AI has learned. Don’t waste your time (or ours) just to
demonstrate that AI can solve the given problem.
e Learning at 42 isn’t about knowing the answer — it’s about developing the ability
to find one. AI gives you the answer directly, but that prevents you from building
your own reasoning. And reasoning takes time, effort, and involves failure. The
path to success is not supposed to be easy.
e Keep in mind that during exams, Al is not available — no internet, no smartphones,
etc. You'll quickly realise if you’ve relied too heavily on AI in your learning process.
e Peer learning exposes you to different ideas and approaches, improving your inter-
personal skills and your ability to think divergently. That’s far more valuable than
just chatting with a bot. So don’t be shy — talk, ask questions, and learn together!
e Yes, AI will be part of the curriculum — both as a learning tool and as a topic
in itself. You’ll even have the chance to build your own AI software. In order to
learn more about our crescendo approach you'll go through in the documentation
available on the intranet.
Y Good practice:
I’m stuck on a new concept. I ask someone nearby how they approached it. We talk
for 10 minutes — and suddenly it clicks. I get it.
X Bad practice:
I secretly use AI, copy some code that looks right. During peer evaluation, I can’t
explain anything. I fail. During the exam — no AI — I’m stuck again. I fail.

Chapter III
Foreword
Cod liver oil is a nutritional supplement derived from the liver of codfish (Gadidae
Like most fish oils, it contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, including
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Cod liver oil is
also rich in vitamins A and D.
Historically, it has been consumed for its vitamin A and vitamin D content.
It was once commonly given to children, as vitamin D has been shown to prevent
rickets and other symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.
In contrast to cod liver oil, C is good, make sure to eat some!

C Piscine C 00
Milestone Achieved, Keep Going!
You have reached the end of the mandatory exercises required to validate this project.
Now, it’s up to you to decide whether to continue with the following optional exercises
or move on to your next project. Both paths will expose you to valuable concepts sooner
or later.
To make your decision, consider the following points:
e The very first exam focuses on C programming. If you’ve already worked on the
first C project, this experience will be useful. The same applies to the "rush" at the
end of the week (you'll soon learn more about it).
e Your excellence in this Piscine is evaluated based on multiple factors. Completing
each project is important, but your overall progress across all Piscine projects also
plays a key role. Choose wisely to optimize your results.
e You can always revisit and retry the same project in a few days or weeks, up until
the end of the Piscine.
e Staying synchronized with your peers fosters better collaboration.

Chapter IX
Exercise 05: ft print comb
Turn-in directory: ex05/
Allowed functions: write
e Create a function that displays all unique combinations of three distinct digits,

e 987 is not included because 789 already covers that combination.
e 999 is not included because the digit 9 appears more than once.
e The function should be prototyped as follows:
S Did you check with your neighbor on the right?
